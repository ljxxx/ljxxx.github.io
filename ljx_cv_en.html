    I am a Master student of <a href="http://iss.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">International School of Software</a>, <a href="http://www.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a>, majoring in Software Engineering.
</p>

<p>
    During my graduate studies, my research focuses on indoor localization based on magnetic field with the instruction of the Prof.Congshi Jiang,
    including design & develop an indoor localization system, design & accomplish the relevant algorithms.
    Now, I am focus on geomagnetic matching algorithm based on machine learning.
    My research result published on <a href="http://gsw2017.3snews.net/" target="_blank">The ISPRS Geospatial Week 2017</a>, and was selected for a poster presentation.
</p>

<p>
    During undergraduate studies, I joined  <a href="http://www.bdcclab.com/index.htm" target="_blank">BDCCL</a>(Big Data and Cloud Computing Lab),
    my research focuses on storage and processing of
    remote sensing data based on Openstack and Hadoop, with the direction of Prof.Xiaohui Cui(Dean of International School of Software, Wuhan University).
